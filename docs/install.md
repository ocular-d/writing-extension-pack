### Vale

The core component of Vale's extension system are collections of writing guidelines called [styles](https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/getting-started/styles "Link to Vale docs about styles").

These guidelines are expressed through rules, which are YAML files enforcing a particular writing constructâ€”e.g., ensuring a certain readability level, sentence length, or heading style.

#### Example Style

:exclamation: ocld requires Vale >= **1.7.0**. :exclamation:

Download the [latest ocld release](https://github.com/ocular-d/ocld/releases "Link to GitHub release page of ocld"),
copy the "ocular-d" directory to your `StylesPath`, and include it in your configuration file:

```ini
# This goes in a file named either `.vale.ini` or `_vale.ini`.
StylesPath = path/to/some/directory
MinAlertLevel = warning # suggestion, warning or error

# Only Markdown and .txt files; change to whatever you're using.
[*.{md,txt}]
# List of styles to load.
BasedOnStyles = ocular-d
```

You can find more examples and styles in the [Vale collection library](https://github.com/errata-ai/styles "Link to style collection").
